L2F – Contributor Assignment Agreement
======================================

In order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions from any person or entity, L2F SA, Bâtiment D EPFL Innovation Park, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland (**L2F**) must have a Contributor Assignment Agreement on file that has been signed by each Contributor, indicating agreement to the terms below. This agreement (the **Agreement**) is for Your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of L2F.

You accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for Your present and future Contributions submitted to L2F. Except for the rights granted herein to L2F, and (at L2F’s discretion) recipients of software made available by L2F, You reserve all right, title, and interest in and to Your Contributions.

1.	Definitions
---------------

**You** (or **Your**) shall mean the copyright owner or legal entity authorized by the copyright owner that is making this Agreement with L2F. For legal entities, the entity making a Contribution and all other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity are considered to be a single Contributor. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

**Contribution** shall mean the code, documentation, or any other original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to L2F for inclusion in, or documentation of, any of the products owned or managed by L2F (the **Work**). For the purposes of this definition, **submitted** means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to L2F or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, L2F for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution".

**Your Essential Patent Claims** shall mean all patent claims owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner of making, using, or selling Your Contribution, but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of Your Contribution. For purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this Agreement.

2.	Copyrights 
--------------

(a)	At the time Your Contribution is Submitted, You assign to L2F all right, title, and interest worldwide in all rights of authorship and other copyrights covering Your Contribution.
(b)	To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1 cannot be assigned by You to L2F, You grant to L2F a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under such non-assigned rights, with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to practice such non-assigned rights, including, but not limited to, the right to reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, propagate, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution.
(c)	To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1 can neither be assigned nor licensed by You to L2F, You irrevocably waive and agree never to assert such rights against L2F, any of L2F’s successors in interest, or any of L2F’s licensees, either direct or indirect. 
(d)	Upon such transfer of rights to L2F, to the maximum extent possible, L2F immediately grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable license under such rights covering Your Contribution, with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of sublicensees, to reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, propagate, sublicense, and distribute Your Contribution. The intention of the parties hereto is that this license will be as broad as possible and to provide You with rights as similar as possible to the owner of the rights that You transferred. This license back is limited to Your Contribution and does not provide any further rights to the Work.

3.	Patents
-----------

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to L2F, and (at L2F’s discretion) to recipients of software distributed by L2F, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license under Your Essential Patent Claims to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise run, modify, transfer or propagate the content of Your Contribution and  the Work to which You have contributed. If any entity institutes patent litigation against You or any other entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that Your Contribution, or the Work to which You have contributed, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to that entity on the basis of this Agreement for that Contribution or Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
